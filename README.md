Digital Logic Design Final Project
Dual Dice Roller Using Counters & 555 Timer (Proteus Simulation)

Overview

The Dual Dice Roller is a fully digital, hardware-based random number generator designed using 555 Timers, Decade Counters, Seven-Segment Displays, and basic logic gates.
Instead of software or microcontrollers, this project showcases how pure digital logic can be used to simulate the rolling of two dice simultaneously.


Each die operates independently, receiving clock pulses from its own 555 timer. The counters cycle through numbers rapidly, and when the clock stops, each display freezes at a random number between 1 and 6 — exactly like rolling real dice.

This project demonstrates key concepts from Digital Logic Design:
✔ Pulse generation

✔ Sequential logic

✔ Counter control

✔ Display decoding

✔ Reset logic
